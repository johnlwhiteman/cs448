## Description

This exercise highlight the differences between AND/OR/XOR bitwise operations when random values are applied to the original pixel values. 



## How to Run

`$ ./aox.py grace-hopper.jpg`

Three pictures will be generated based on bitwise operation.

`$ eog AND-grace-hopper.jpg`

`$ eog OR-grace-hopper.jpg`
